# README

## Run code

To run this project locally:

- Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Create file tech-tree/.env.local & NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
- npm i
- npm run dev
- You'll find the tech-tree on http://localhost:3000/tech-tree

## Data structure

All nodes and edges are inside [src/data](src/data). They're sorted by level, starting with the lowest on the left side of the graph.

You can **find a node** in two ways:

- Copy the node's name from the graph and search for this string in the IDE (shortcut: usually CTRL + SHIFT + F).
- Check the level the node is in and navigate to the corresponding file in [src/data](src/data). Search for the node there (for example, by its name and STRG + F).

If you want to **add or modify a node** or edge, you have two options:

- **Manually in the code** (e.g., directly in the files under src/data)
- **Via UI support** (see next sections)

To delete a node or edge, the corresponding object must be removed manually in the level-x-nodes.ts/level-x-edges.ts file in [src/data](src/data).

## Add or edit node with UI-support

1. **Add or select a node**
   - Click "Add node" or
   - Click on an existing one to edit it.
2. **Make changes**
   - Modify values in the editor (on the right) and click "Save (Only temporarily)".
   - Move the node to change its position.
   - Resize the node if needed.
3. **Copy the JSON**
   - After each change the node's new code is automatically copied into your clipboard.
   - You can also click manually on "Copy code to clipboard" in the editorâ€™s top-right corner.
4. **Paste the code**
   - Insert the copied code into the respective level-x-nodes.ts file in [src/data](src/data).
   - Insert the node's variable name in the array (in the same file where the node was added).
5. **Verify the node was edited/added**
   - Find the edited/added node on http://localhost:3000/tech-tree
   - Validate it's properties

## Add edge with UI-support

1. **Create an edge**
   - Connect two nodes with an edge.
   - The edge is automatically copied into your clipboard.
   - You can also click manually on an existing edge to copy it into your clipboard.
2. **Paste the code**
   - Insert the copied code into the respective level-x-edges.ts file in [src/data](src/data).
   - Insert the edges's variable name in the array (in the same file where the edge was added).
3. **Verify the edge was added**
   - Find the added edge on http://localhost:3000/tech-tree
